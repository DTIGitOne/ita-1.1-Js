Sixth project: I decided that the knowledge I gained from everything I learned was enough to make a frontend log in page for this project.

For this, I learned regular expressions (Regex) and used them with my JavaScript logic to verify the input values. After the user types in all the information, I would validate that all of the data types (password, email, username) are valid before sending it to a backend server to check for other errors, such as if the username already exists. I simply checked if the email format was (email@email.com) and not just random letters so i wouldnâ€™t be sending pointless requests to backend to check if something like (asdsada,asd) is a email or not.

I also made a bracket where all of the data is stored when all of the input values are valid and i displayed it after creation. I designed it to mimic how your data would have been stored if you were logging into an actual site. After creating the users' information, I also created a unique id for each new user created. The user should be able to view all of his details by simply entering their ID and checking all of their saved information.

Here is where I made the second page of my project to allow for checking IDs. However, I forgot one important fact at the time, and that was the fact that I did not have a database and I had no idea where to save information, so all I did was make a Regex for the correct ID format and pretended that the ID input just checked if it existed, but in reality it just checked if the format was correct.

This project took me about 2 days and i was really happy with the result of me making it.
